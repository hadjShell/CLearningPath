The BOPE is the squad of special forces of police that usually handles the operations in the Favelas in Rio de Janeiro.
In this Kata you have to write a function that determine the number of magazines that every soldier has to have in his bag.
You will receive the weapon and the number of streets that they have to cross. Considering that every street the officer shoots 3 times. Bellow there is the relation of weapons:
PT92 - 17 bullets
M4A1 - 30 bullets
M16A2 - 30 bullets
PSG1 - 5 bullets

Example:

["PT92", 6] => 2 (6 streets 3 bullets each)
["M4A1", 6] => 1
The return Will always be an integer so as the params.

Answer:

```c
#include <stddef.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>

typedef struct _Gun {
  char *name;
  unsigned mag_bullets;
} Gun;

static Gun guns[] = {
  {"M16A2", 30}, {"M4A1", 30}, {"PSG1", 5}, {"PT92", 17}, {NULL, 0}
};

size_t mag_number(const char *weapon_name, size_t streets)
{
  for (Gun *g = guns; g->name; g++)
    if (!strcmp(weapon_name, g->name))
      return ceil(3. * streets / g->mag_bullets);
  
  return 0;
}
```

Notes:

* 注意结构体数组中增加一个结尾元素的技巧，以及对应的循环判断条件
* 向上取整函数`ceil`

Bob is bored during his physics lessons so he's built himself a toy box to help pass the time. The box is special because it has the ability to change gravity.
There are some columns of toy cubes in the box arranged in a line. The `i`-th column contains `a_i` cubes. At first, the gravity in the box is pulling the cubes downwards. When Bob switches the gravity, it begins to pull all the cubes to a certain side of the box, `d`, which can be either `'L'` or `'R'` (left or right). Below is an example of what a box of cubes might look like before and after switching gravity.

```
+---+                                       +---+
|   |                                       |   |
+---+                                       +---+
+---++---+     +---+              +---++---++---+
|   ||   |     |   |   -->        |   ||   ||   |
+---++---+     +---+              +---++---++---+
+---++---++---++---+         +---++---++---++---+
|   ||   ||   ||   |         |   ||   ||   ||   |
+---++---++---++---+         +---++---++---++---+
```

Given the initial configuration of the cubes in the box, find out how many cubes are in each of the `n` columns after Bob switches the gravity.

Examples (input -> output):

```
* 'R', [3, 2, 1, 2]      ->  [1, 2, 2, 3]
* 'L', [1, 4, 5, 3, 5 ]  ->  [5, 5, 4, 3, 1]
```

Answer：

```c
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef int (*srt_func)(const void*, const void*);

int asc(const void* a, const void* b) { return ( *(int*)a - *(int*)b ); }
int dsc(const void* a, const void* b) { return ( *(int*)b - *(int*)a ); }
srt_func srt(char d) { return d == 'R' ? asc : dsc; }

void flip(char d, const int* array, size_t n, int* result) {
  for (int i = 0; i < (int)n; i++) result[i] = array[i];
  qsort(result, n, sizeof(int), srt(d));
}
```

Notes:

* 注意`qsort`的用法，最后一个参数接受一个指向升降序函数的指针
* 注意`typedef`一个指向函数的指针类型

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Examples

```c
high_and_low("1 2 3 4 5", result)  // result "5 1"
high_and_low("1 2 -3 4 5", result) // result "5 -3"
high_and_low("1 9 3 4 -5", result) // result "9 -5"
```

- All numbers are valid `Int32`, no *need* to validate them.
- There will always be at least one number in the input string.
- Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

Answer:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>

void high_and_low (const char *strnum, char *result)
{
  int min = INT_MAX, max = INT_MIN;
  while (*strnum) {
    int n, x;
    sscanf(strnum, "%d %n", &x, &n);
    strnum += n;
    if (x < min) min = x;
    if (x > max) max = x;
  }
  sprintf(result, "%d %d", max, min);
}
```

Notes:

* 注意`INT_MAX`，`INT_MIN`的使用，减少在循环外最开始的初始化

* 注意`sscanf`的使用

  > In C, `%n` is a special format specifier. In the case of `printf` function the `%n` assign the number of characters printed by `printf`. When we use the `%n` in `scanf` it will assign the number of characters read by the `scanf` function until it occurs.
