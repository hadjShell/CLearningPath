Description:

The BOPE is the squad of special forces of police that usually handles the operations in the Favelas in Rio de Janeiro.
In this Kata you have to write a function that determine the number of magazines that every soldier has to have in his bag.
You will receive the weapon and the number of streets that they have to cross. Considering that every street the officer shoots 3 times. Bellow there is the relation of weapons:
PT92 - 17 bullets
M4A1 - 30 bullets
M16A2 - 30 bullets
PSG1 - 5 bullets

Example:

["PT92", 6] => 2 (6 streets 3 bullets each)
["M4A1", 6] => 1
The return Will always be an integer so as the params.

Answer:

```c
#include <stddef.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>

typedef struct _Gun {
  char *name;
  unsigned mag_bullets;
} Gun;

static Gun guns[] = {
  {"M16A2", 30}, {"M4A1", 30}, {"PSG1", 5}, {"PT92", 17}, {NULL, 0}
};

size_t mag_number(const char *weapon_name, size_t streets)
{
  for (Gun *g = guns; g->name; g++)
    if (!strcmp(weapon_name, g->name))
      return ceil(3. * streets / g->mag_bullets);
  
  return 0;
}
```

Notes:

* 注意结构体数组中增加一个结尾元素的技巧，以及对应的循环判断条件
* 向上取整函数`ceil`
